This means that when you pass a parameter to a function they don't actually check to see that the type of the parameter is the right type to be passed to that function. Further, some of these languages might be able to have variables where you don't even declare the type of the variable. The type of the variable is determined by the value which is assigned to it and, if you assign a different value to the same variable, you can change the type of the variable. Many programmers think that this is a very handy thing to be able to do but it removes the compiler's ability to check to see that you are using the right types during the compilation process. Some of the languages in this category include scripting languages like Bash as well as popular languages like Python and JavaScript. All of these languages are much more weakly typed than C and C++."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"The major problem with weakly typed languages is that all of the bugs, other than pure syntactic bugs, are runtime bugs.

This certainly does not prove that the program is correct, but it does demonstrate that it handles most real-world situations."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"The development of strongly typed languages was one of the steps forward that allowed us to write software of the size and quality that we have today.

The downside of the strongly typed languages is that you need to declare the types of all variables and function parameters as well as spend time creating structures and classes. This is a time consuming process that many programmers prefer to skip.
