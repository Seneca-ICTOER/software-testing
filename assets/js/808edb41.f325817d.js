The problems came to a head in the 1960s during the system 360 operating system development project. This was an attempt to write an operating system for the IBM 360 mainframe computer. This was the largest, most complex software project ever attempted. Problems started to appear during the development of the project and by the end of the project it had the same problems of so many projects of that era: over budget, behind schedule, and bug ridden.
