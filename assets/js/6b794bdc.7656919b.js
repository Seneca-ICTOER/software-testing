The idea is to test small units of code and make sure that they work perfectly before they are combined with other pieces of code into much larger programs. The concept is that it is easier to find a bug in a small piece of code than it is to find it in larger program. Further, we like to build on code which is known to be solid and bug free. If we know that the individual units that we use in a program are free from bugs, we do not have to look at the low level code to check for bugs but rather look at the way it has been integrated.\nUnit tests normally cast individual functions bypassing them unknown piece of data and checking to see that the result is what is expected.

If we simply rely on black box testing there is no guarantee that we would have tested every single path through the code. There could be rarely used pieces of code which have never actually been tested by black box testing and therefore we have no proof that they work correctly.
